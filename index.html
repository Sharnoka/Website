    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <img src="images/dekubabycut.jpg" alt="Baby Deku" width="400" height="250"/>
    <p>Izuku Midoriya was born with no quirk. But due to his innate heroism, he becomes the pupil of All Might. All Might has passed the torch to Izuku. And has become the 9th holder of One For All. As he gained physical strength, he could not wield One For All.  Izuku would end up breaking his own body to use his new found power. At a young age, he would gather intelligence on Super Hero’s, with his analytical side he can perform complex battle plans. He would later learn how to use his power at 5%, by training with Gran Torino, former teacher of All Might.  With that 5%, he was able to take down Hero Killer: Stain, alongside Shoto Todoroki, and Tenya Iida. He was acknowledged, by Stain, as a true hero.</p>
    <p div class="p-hero">Now he is destined to become the greatest hero in the world. </p>

    <h2>Abilities<Abilities id="abilities"></h2>
    <h3>Keen Intellect:</h3>
    <img src="images/izukunotes.png" alt="Full Cowl" width="400" height="310" class="float-1-1"/>
    <p  class="p-left">Prior to receiving his quirk, his greatest asset was his vast knowledge of fundamental hero skills and tactics. His records come in a form of Hero Analysis for the Future. Izuku is the type of person to think before he acts. His great foresight in this manner has earned him the praise and shock of many.</p>
    <h3>High Pain Tolerance:</h3>
    <img src="images/izukupain.jpg" alt="Izuku Pain" Width="400" height="310" class="float-2-1" />
    <p class="p-right">Izuku has shown on many occasions that he is able to handle and bear with a lot of pain, such times are mostly because of the repercussion of over-using his Quirk. However, he can still manage to move his body despite feeling excruciating pain, which was seen in his fights with Muscular and Katsuki.</p>
    <h2>Quirk<Quirk id="quirk"></h2>
    <h3>One For All:</h3>
    <p>Given to him by All Might, giving him access to stockpiled power, granting him superhuman strength and greatly enhancing his mobility by spreading out his power throughout his body.</p>

    <h2>Super Moves <Supermoves id="supermoves"></h2>
    <h3>Detroit Smash:</h3>
    <img src="images/dekusmash.gif" alt="Deku Smash" width="400" height="250"/><p>The same as All Might's move, except Izuku does it in the form of an uppercut.</p>
    <h3>Delaware Smash:</h3>
    <img src="images/dekuicesmash.gif" alt="Ice Smash" width="400" height="124" class="float-1-2" />
    <p class="p-left">Izuku flicks his finger to create a powerful wind pressure shock wave that has enough force to break large chunks of ice.</p>
    <h3>One For All: Full Cowling:</h3>
    <img src="images/fullcowling.gif" alt="Full Cowl" width="400" height="372" class="float-2-2" />
    <p class="p-right">Through his training with Gran Torino, Izuku was able to unlock this stage of his power and get better control of his Quirk. This technique allows Izuku to activate 8% of One For All throughout his body, letting the power course and flow through him instead of concentrating it in one location. Activating this technique gives him enhanced strength, speed, mobility, and agility.</p>
    <h3>One For All: Full Cowling – Shoot Style:</h3>
    <img src="images/ironsole.gif" alt="Full Cowl" width="400" height="185" class="float-1-3" />
    <p class="p-left">While using One For All: Full Cowl, Izuku uses a fighting style that focuses more on kicking. Izuku concentrates One for All: Full Cowl's effects in his torso and legs rather than his arms</p>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <h3>Costume Gamma:</h3>
    <img src="images/gammasuit.png" alt="Izuku Defending" Width="400" height="250" class="float-2-3" />
    <p class="p-right">Following Izuku's decision to change his combat to Shoot Style, new additions consist of improved arm bracers that span the length of Izuku's arm in order to prevent further damage to them and iron soles to increase his kicking power.</p>
    <h3>Iron Soles:</h3>
    <img src="images/dekuironsoles.png" alt="Iron Soles" width="400" height="217" class="float-1-4" />
    <p class="p-left">The Iron Armor Soles attached to Izuku's signature red shoes. Upon kicking something, the soles absorb the impact and redistribute the kinetic energy back out to increase the impact strength of Izuku's kicks.</p>
    <h3>Air Force Gloves:</h3>
    <img src="images/dekuairforcegloves.png" alt="Air Force Gloves" width="400" height="122" class="float-2-4"/>
    <p class="p-right-1">They allow Izuku to utilize pressurized air created by Full Cowl and use it as projectiles by flicking his finger.</p>
